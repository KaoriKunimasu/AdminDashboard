Configuration
Theme Customization
Modify the theme settings in src/config/theme.js to change colors, typography, and layout options:

Copy// Example theme configuration
module.exports = {
  colors: {
    primary: '#3498db',
    secondary: '#2ecc71',
    accent: '#9b59b6',
    background: '#f5f7fa',
    text: '#34495e'
  },
  typography: {
    fontFamily: '"Roboto", "Helvetica", "Arial", sans-serif',
    fontSize: {
      small: '0.875rem',
      medium: '1rem',
      large: '1.25rem',
      xlarge: '1.5rem'
    }
  }
}
Data Source Configuration
Configure data sources in src/config/dataSources.js:

Copy// Example data source configuration
module.exports = {
  primary: {
    endpoint: process.env.API_URL,
    refreshInterval: 60000, // milliseconds
    timeout: 5000
  },
  analytics: {
    endpoint: process.env.ANALYTICS_API,
    apiKey: process.env.ANALYTICS_KEY
  }
}
Performance Optimization
The dashboard implements several performance optimizations:

Data caching for frequently accessed metrics
Lazy loading of dashboard components
Virtualized lists for large data sets
Optimized chart rendering with throttled updates
Code splitting to reduce initial load time
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Issue: Dashboard data isn't updating. Solution: Check your API connectivity and refresh interval settings in the configuration.

Issue: Charts not rendering correctly. Solution: Verify browser compatibility and check console for errors. Try clearing browser cache.

Issue: Authentication failures. Solution: Reset your credentials through the account recovery process or contact the system administrator.
